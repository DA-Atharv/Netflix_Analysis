# Introduction:
Netflix, a renowned subscription-based streaming service, boasts a vast library of films and television series, including original productions. This project aims to provide insightful data visualizations derived from the Netflix movies and TV shows dataset sourced from Kaggle "(https://www.kaggle.com/code/ridwanadejumo/basic-data-visualization-on-the-netflix-dataset)". Through analysis and visualization, we seek to uncover trends, preferences, and patterns within Netflix's content offerings.
